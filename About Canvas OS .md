This domain ensures consistency, coherence, and expansion by setting your system’s logic, language, rules, and operational mechanics.

**Components of the Foundation Domain:** 
1. Canvas Philosophy & Purpose 
2. Principles & Logic 
3. System Mechanics 
4. Customization & Settings 
5. System Vocabulary & Syntax 
6. Templates & Expansion Rules 
7. Canvas OS Changelog & Updates
8. Integration Points

### 🟣 **2. Expansion Axis**
The Expansion Axis drives the **growth and application** of your knowledge, routines, and systems. It is to scale your life by building structured **systems** and **strategies** that guide learning, behavior, productivity, and personal evolution.

These systems are like modular “programs” you install into your life to automate growth, maintain well-being, and enhance performance.

**Examples of Systems in the System Domain:** 
- Job System 
- Academic System
- Fitness System
- Entertainment System 
- AI System 
- Energy System 
- Time System
### 🔴 3. Utility Axis
It **bridges external tools and digital platforms** directly into the Canvas OS — enabling frictionless use of applications, utilities, and online resources within your second brain. This axis serves as your **integration layer** — connecting your thinking systems with the apps and sites that enhance execution, learning, automation, and workflow. The Utility Axis has 1 domain. 

#### 🛠️ Application Domain
The **Application Domain** is a collection tool dock for websites that acts as tools for the Canvas OS. These websites can be placed into a .canvas files by using the Iframe plugin, which can be used in every part of the Canvas OS. 

### 🟢 4. Perpective Axis 
To enhance **meta-awareness**, multi-angle analysis, and high-level reflection across your entire Canvas OS.

#### 👁️ Perspective Domain
The **Perspective Domain** is your **lens module** — it provides you with curated frameworks to **reframe, inspect, compare, or recontextualize** different parts of your Canvas OS. It’s lets you see the Canvas OS in different angles, domains, and perspectives.

#### 🧱 **Layer Domain**
The **Layer Domain** introduces **verticality** and **depth** into the Canvas OS — enabling you to think in **stacks, overlays, or tiers**. It mimics a 3D structure where different informational "layers".
